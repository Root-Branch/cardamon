## Scenarios

A scenario encapsulates a usage behaviour that you want to measure (e.g. add items to basket). You can then run your code against these repeateable behaviours and see how your software power consumption changes over time. You can view this in the cardamon-ui. Cardamon scenarios are compatible with [ISO/IEC 21031 - Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) specification](https://www.iso.org/standard/86612.html). 

## Live Monitor
